-Moving a wordpress blog to our domain is $13 per year

-At the moment, we are sort of stuck using limited templates
--We could pay ~$30 for extra design options
--We should not stay with this free option forever as it takes quite a bit of code wrangling to customize pages. To the point where a CMS is not really necessary.

-If we want to really fit the website into our branding image, we need to decide a few things
--CMS => Easy to use, some limits on functionality (can be overcome with plugins)
----Wordpress => Probably the best way to go, but not the only way
----Drupal => Popular Wordpress alternative
--Work from templates => More control, less WYSIWYG (but modularity of code bits make give it coherent structure)
----Bootstrap
----Others

-Whatever the case may be:
--We need to get access to our domain
----I think I could do this, but probably would be best to have Michael/Sophicity handle this
----Even if we don't pay wordpress for the domain pointing, we need to at least get gscplanning.com to redirect to gscplanning.wordpress.com
--We need the webserver set up
----Ask Whitley (again...sorry Whitley) about our 1&1/GoDaddy situation and what was the webhosting situation supposed to be
--I think we should use this as an opportunity to revisit our web rules
----Should Mary have to do everything?
----Can we create a set of rules that determine when, where, and something gets added, edited, or deleted?
----Can GIS have some more control over its portion of the site?
----How might we use social media (namely Twitter & Facebook) to inform people about what's going on, deadlines, etc
------Main St.: Facebook
------CoC: Facebook, Twitter
------County Clerk: Facebook
------How are other departments using social media to enhance their service?
